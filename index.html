        <div>Here's a timeline of Prof. Edsger W. Dijkstra's life:</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Born in Rotterdam on 11 May 1930.</li>
          <li>Studied theoretical Physics at the University of Leiden.</li>
          <li>
            Worked at the Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam from 1952 till 1962.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the late 1960s, he built the THE operating system which
            influenced later operating systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Joined the Burroughs Corporation in 1973 as a research fellow.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Burroughs years saw him at his prolific best - writing nearly
            500 articles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dijkstra accepted the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in the Computer
            Science Department at the University of Texas at Austin in 1984.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dijkstra worked in Austin until his retirement in November 1999.
          </li>
          <li>Died of cancer in Nuenen, Netherlands, on 6 August 2002.</li>
          <li>
            He made fundamental contributions to the following domains of
            Computer Science -
            <ul id="inner-list">
              <li>algorithm design</li>
              <li>programming languages</li>
              <li>program design</li>
              <li>operating systems</li>
              <li>distributed processing</li>
              <li>formal specification and verification</li>
              <li>design of mathematical arguments</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          The difference between a computer programmer and a computer scientist
          is a job-title thing. Edsger Dijkstra wants proudly to be called a
          "computer programmer," although he hasn't touched a computer now for
          some years. (...) His great strength is that he is uncompromising. It
          would make him physically ill to think of programming in C++.
